Players navigate a 3D world but are restricted to X & Z axis, so in order to move along Y axis, they can slice through the world with a cutting plane, creating 2D cross-sections that become separate playable levels. This mechanic was developed as my qualification project for my diploma in short cycle professional higher education.",
