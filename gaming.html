    <h2 id="Him">Him</h2>
   <p>A colorful strip stretched across the sky like a magic ribbon. The rainbow always pleases the eye, it inspires something warm, inexplicable in the soul. Holes gaped here and there in the snowdrifts, from which snow-white flowers timidly raised their heads. The brook flowing from the mountains murmured merrily. The surrounding world breathed life. You knelt down wearily after many hours of movement, scooped up a handful of water from a stream sparkling in the sun and splashed it in your face. Your faithful fluffy companion happily jumped into the water, dousing you with a cloud of spray, and began to rush through the water.</p>
</div> <div class="hidden-left"><hr><p class="hidden-text"><b>Cocker Spaniels</b> were bred as birding dogs and tend to have higher energy levels. While they love exercise and activity, they do also enjoy spending time with their people and cuddle next to them on the couch.  Their trusting personality makes them a great fit for families who have small children, other pets, or elderly owners. When properly socialized, this breed is an excellent family dog. However, you must remember that if you have not trained your Spaniel to cope with loneliness, then don't leave him alone too much. He will become mentally disturbed!</p><hr></div>
  <p>You wiped your face with your sleeve and cast an annoyed glance at the merry dog. But he, feeling the attention and being completely ignorant of its nature, rushed to you and licked on the cheek. Why are you pushing him away? What makes you gloomy even on such a literally cloudless day? Well now, he must have picked up on your blues. He lay down under a bush and began whining quietly.</p>
    <p>It's too late to call him to you and pet that hairy back, expecting him to immediately wag his tail happily. How do you know what's going on in that eared head right now? Do you know that he also worries about you and wonders what is in your soul?</p>
<div class="hidden-right"><hr><p class="hidden-text">The compact, medium-sized <b>Chinese Shar-Pei</b> is an amalgam of odd physical traits: a broad 'hippopotamus' muzzle; a blue-black tongue; small, sunken eyes with a scowling expression; tiny triangular ears; abundant folds of loose skin about the head, neck, and shoulders. The Shar Pei is great family dog that is devoted to and very protective of its family, but they can be a bit wary of strangers. The Shar Pei is also a good dog for families where children are just that bit older. This dog also needs consistent training to ensure that the dog knows its place in the family pecking order.</p><hr></div>

<div class="text-section-3">
    <h2 id="YouAndHim">You and Him</h2>
    <p>From the hill, a beautiful view opens up, as if descended from the pages of a fairy tale. Flocks of clouds are running across the bright blue summer sky, below them birds are soaring proudly, with their strong wings spread widely. The fiery disk, frozen in the sky, generously endows the earth with warmth. Ahead stretched a spacious meadow, filled with the buzz of bees. Flowers of all colors and types exude wonderful fragrances, inviting the casual passer-by to go deeper. But this wonderful meadow was divided into two parts by a narrow road, old, abandoned and broken. Once upon a time, people used to walk on it.</p>
</div> <div class="hidden-left"><hr><p class="hidden-text">Versatile, hardy, loyal, protective and playful are just some of the words used to describe the <b>East European Shepherd</b>. This breed is an intelligent dog who needs a strong leader/owner to bring out the best in them. Being a large dog, they can be a bit stubborn unless they have someone to look up to. Generally considered dogkind's finest all-purpose worker, it is a agile, muscular dog of noble character and high intelligence. They are truly a dog lover's delight.</p><hr></div>
<div class="text-section"> <p>And here you are standing on a hill, ready to go down this road. You thoughtfully look at the sky, at the horizon, and oh, how you want to know what thoughts are now in your head. You take the first steps, and your eternal traveler rushes forward, stops ahead and calls you to quicken your pace with a ringing bark. You smile involuntarily, looking at the four-legged inexhaustible source of joy, but you do not share his fun. You don't stop for a second, you don't pay attention to the beauty around you, you walk along the old, dirty road. Although you could walk through the flowers.</p>
    <p>You go into the distance, your figures gradually turn into two dark dots, and soon they disappear too.</p>
    <p>Answer only one question: Where are you going, O wayfarer? Maybe somewhere far away, your beloved is waiting for you?</p>
</div><div class="hidden-right"><hr><p class="hidden-text">Known as happy, outgoing dogs, <b>Papillons</b> enjoy sitting in laps as much as they like running around the house. Although lively and energetic, they are not considered high-strung or nervous and are easy to care for. The papillon is a descendant of a European toy spaniel. Also, interestingly, it has no doggy odor. Papillons are great family dogs, since they are affectionate with the people they have bonded with and have the energetic personality to keep up with children. Their small size, however, puts them at a slight risk around young children who may be clumsy and inadvertently injure the dog.</p><hr></div>
<div class="text-section"> <p>Does your goal not allow you to enjoy what is around right now?</p>
    <p>I'm afraid I'll never get an answer. And never will you hear the question.</p>
</div>
<br><br>
<p>End of the story? Not at all. This story is written by each one of us. We rush forward, trying to keep up with the sunset. However, my dear friend, we are in such a hurry that sometimes we forget about a simple thing: friend. Everyone needs a friend. And we can help you with that. If you do not have a faithful dog who will always stand by your side, then now, in these dark times, is the time to find it. </p>
